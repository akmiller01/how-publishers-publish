Recent developments using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) show great promise in identifying geographic origin more reliably and economically than previous methods. This project will refine the method for mapping DNA to source sites by analyzing the complete mitogenome of existing high quality samples, analyzing samples taken from ivory to determine specific provenance and analyzing more degraded samples from museum specimens for sites that are presently impossible to sample (i.e. warzones and sites where elephants are now rare or extirpated).

The project is intended to primarily conserve the park\u2019s populations of forest elephants, chimpanzees, gorillas, coastal dolphins, leatherback and olive ridley sea turtles, and large monkeys, as well as other threatened and iconic forest and aquatic species such as pangolins and manatees. This multi-year agreement will address hunting for the commercial bushmeat trade, poaching for ivory, illegal fishing, and other key threats to wildlife via five main objectives: control of illegal killing and park encroachment on land, control of illegal killing and bycatch in park waters, development of a better evidence base to adaptively manage park activities, improvement of community support of the park, and enhancement of management capacity to implement and oversee important park programs. Specific activities in the first year include: (1) ecoguard patrols to protect the terrestrial portion of the park, including training and equipment; (2) support for a Wildlife Crime Unit to ensure arrests and confiscations lead to fair trials and prosecutions; (3) engagement with extractive industries to promote better management practices and to remain vigilant of illegal activities or encroachment; (4) patrols in marine waters to reduce illegal killing and bycatch; (5) support for a net compensation program to release sea turtles accidentally caught in local fishermen\u2019s nets; (6) implementation of a law enforcement monitoring system (i.e., SMART) to more effectively plan patrol effort and evaluate performance; (7) continuation of a beach monitoring program to maintain a low poaching level of sea turtle nests; (8) improvements to ecotourism infrastructure to generate more revenue for communities and development of a community development strategy and better revenue-sharing scheme to decrease incentives for community members engaged in illegal activities in the park; and (9) support for park operations, including equipment and logistics, and exploration of a private-public partnership to ensure the park management unit has sufficient personnel and operational capacity to implement and oversee key conservation activities.. commercial bushmeat trade, poaching for ivory,. multi-year agreement will address hunting for the",

        "African grey parrots are intensively hunted throughout their range for the trade in live birds and parrot parts. Since the 1990\u2019s, much of the legal trade has shifted from West Africa to Central Africa where local populations are rapidly declining. African grey parrots were uplisted to Appendix I at the 17th CITES Conference of the Parties (CoP) in 2016. This uplisting bans the commercial trade and harvest of wild-caught parrots. In the Republic of Congo (ROC), wild parrots are frequently seized from traffickers, including those crossing the border from Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to illegally harvest parrots. To address the illegal trapping and killing of wild parrots for the live bird and parts trade, this two-year grant will support: collection and standardization of information on parrot trafficking routes to better target law enforcement operations; law enforcement operations to interdict parrot trafficking; training for prosecutors and magistrates on national and international (CITES) legislation to strengthen the application of wildlife laws; technical and legal support to reform national CITES implementation legislation, including support at the next CITES CoP in 2019; and bilateral discussions between ROC and DRC authorities to help combat transboundary parrot trafficking.",

This project will contribute to the conservation of USFWS trust resources and federally protected species, including the world\u2019s largest population of western lowland gorillas and the largest, connected population of forest elephants. Objectives include stabilization of poaching pressures; reliable information on the distribution and status of wildlife; and coordination of conservation activities across six sites in three countries, including targeted joint activities to improve workforce capacity and safeguard local and legal use of wildlife. Each year's financial obligation is approved by USFWS on an annual basis based upon available funding, submission of annual workplans, and a review of the previous year's performance.
